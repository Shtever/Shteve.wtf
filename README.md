# ASK BEEFS #

A collection of really stupid website ideas:

Index.html: Landing page. Link to Zoom meeting room.
TO DO:
1. ~~Add links to other pages.~~

McMillan.html:A joke site, based on the old "Ask Jeeves" search engine.
TO DO:
1. Add Mobile Responsiveness.
2. Reevaluate modal on page load. It looks VERY basic, but it triggers the music, as Google Chrome disallows media to play on page load automatically.


4d3d3d3.html: A mock-up of the "Tayne" sketch from *Tim & Eric Awesome Show: Great Job* starring Paul Rudd.
TO DO:
1. Mobile Responsiveness - Window dimensions
2. Add buttons to show/hide gif windows.


Untapped.html: Page to test various functions in the *Untapped* beer API.
TO DO:
1. Improve search function - Need to reference API documentation.
